Welcome
=======

This project is intended to ease the process of enabling Windows
Remote Management ("WinRM"). On an out-of-the-box install of Windows
Server 2008 R2, WinRM is not enabled or installed by
default. Installing it, and enabling it on an SSL-secured port, takes
many manual steps; this project is intended to automate this as much
as possible, reducing it to a one-liner.

Currently, the aim of the project is to assist in modifying a vanilla
Windows Server 2008 R2 instance inside Amazon EC2, configuring it to
allow the ["overthere"][overthere] project to connect to the WinRM
port in a reasonably secure manner. While it's not exclusively limited
to this kind of setup, at the moment the scripts do make assumptions
to that end.

Usage
=====

Boot up an Amazon EC2 instance based on the [Amazon-provided Windows
Server 2008 R2 images][AMIs]. Log in using Remote Desktop as Administrator,
and open a Command Prompt window. Copy-and-paste this one-liner to
bootstrap the WinRM-Util module, and activate WinRM:

```
PowerShell -Command "Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned ; (new-object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(\"https://raw.github.com/rdowner/WinRM-Util/master/enable-winrm.ps1\", \"enable-winrm.ps1\") ; ./enable-winrm.ps1"
```

Re-seal the EC2 image:

```
"\Program Files\Amazon\Ec2ConfigService\Ec2Config.exe" -sysprep
```

Wait for SysPrep to run, and shut down the instance. Now create a new
AMI from the stopped instance.

Your new AMI will be configured with WinRM enabled on port 5986, using
HTTPS.
